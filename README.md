Psychic Guess Game 
Sample code written by D.J. Reichel

Overview

In this assignment, you'll create one of two possible computer games: Word Guess or Psychic. 
These apps will run in the browser, and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS powered by your JavaScript code.

I find Javascript exceptionally challenging. 
I started this assignment creating a word guess game, but couldn't make that work.

Plan B is the Physic Guess game. I did get a working game, albeit not as pretty as what I hoped for.
